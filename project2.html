          Description of the Data Portrait:
        </p>
        <p>
          For this data-self portrait, I tracked my daily food intake over a week, focusing on five key categories:
          Vegetables, Protein, Carbohydrates (Carbs), Snacks, and Water. The idea was to visualize my eating habits by
          representing each food category as a node, dynamically expanding from the center outward. The portrait shows
          how much I consumed each type of food every day, with different days cycling through the animation from Monday
          to Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instructions for Viewers:
        </p>
        <p>
          Each colored point represents a food category (Vegetables, Protein, Carbs, Snacks, and Water) for a given day
          of the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          The position of the point represents the quantity consumed. The further from the center, the more of that food
          type I consumed on that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design Process:
        </p>
        <p>
          I tracked my daily food intake over seven days, categorizing the food I ate into the five main types mentioned
          above. Each day, I assigned a number to indicate the quantity of each food category I consumed (on a scale
          from 0 to 3, where 3 represents a higher intake and 0 represents no intake).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I sketched out an idea where food categories are positioned in a circular layout, with points expanding
          outward based on intake.The design also includes subtle spider web-like lines to improve clarity in comparing
          intake levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflection on the Assignment:
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this tracking process, I realized how much my eating habits fluctuate day to day. For example, I
          noticed that my vegetable and protein intake is consistent, and water intake varied more than I expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gained: Visualizing my eating habits allowed me to clearly see patterns that would have been harder to notice
          in a simple list of numbers. The circular layout helped me easily compare the relative intake of each food
          type, and the animated dynamic made it more engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lost: One thing that’s lost in the data visualization is the emotional or subjective experience of eating.
          While the portrait provides a clear, objective view of my eating habits, it doesn’t capture how I felt on
          those days or how different foods affected my mood or energy levels.
