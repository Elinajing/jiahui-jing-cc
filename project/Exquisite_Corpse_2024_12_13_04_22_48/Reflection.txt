The shaped head highlights the mechanical feel,and the rounded corners add affinity. The bow adds a cute touch.The lightning bolt on the battery represents the character's powerful source of energy.

New backstory
"Battery" - the wise mentor in a world where humans and machines coexist. In the future, humans and robots coexist, and the character "Battery" is the bridge between the two, symbolizing human wisdom and mechanical power. It is a mentor and guardian, with a pre-designed symbolic balance, and the symbol of lightning contains powerful power.

I think the arm part was the hardest for me to draw. Because I can't determine the value of the arc bend. So I simplified the arm design on the original drawing.
