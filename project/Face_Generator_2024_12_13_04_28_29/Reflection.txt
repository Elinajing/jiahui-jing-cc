I want to make a happy smiley face that can be changed randomly. So I first drew a happy emoji, with the click of the mouse, the eyes and mouth on the smiley face and the size of the face will change.
Some coordinates and values are difficult to understand at first. Through this exercise, I have mastered and understood the use of mouseX and mouseY. I saw the example of our assignment where color transitions can be made randomly and smoothly, and I was very curious about the principle.
